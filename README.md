The Sonatype Platform Browser Extension supercedes the [Sonatype Nexus IQ Evaluation Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sonatype-nexus-iq-evaluat/kahnhlonadjlllgnilndafpajaiepdag), and allows Developers to get insight from the Sonatype Platform for Open Source packages as you browse Public Open Source Registries - i.e. before a package is even downloaded!

## Format Support

### Public Registries

**NOTE:** For the initial versions of this Extension, support for OSS Index has not yet been included (so we could ship quicker!) We'll update here when support is re-introduced.

_Notes:_

1. See issue [#237](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-iq-chrome-extension/issues/237)
2. See issue [#130](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-iq-chrome-extension/issues/130)
3. Run on a public instance of jFrog Artifactory - support coming soon

### Private Hosted Registries

Some public registires are hosted on instances of Sonatype Nexus Repository and jFrog Artifactory. You might also have private instances.

[Sonatype Nexus IQ Evaluation Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sonatype-nexus-iq-evaluat/mjehedmoboadebjmbmobpedkdgenmlhd) has support for both of these types, but this has yet to be ported to this new extension.

### Missing or unsupported Registry?

Missing format or ecosystem? Why not raise an Issue to request?
