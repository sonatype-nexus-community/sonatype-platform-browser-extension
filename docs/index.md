The Sonatype Platform Browser Extension allows Developers to get insight from the 
[Sonatype Platform](https://www.sonatype.com/products/software-supply-chain-management) 
for Open Source packages as you browse Public Open Source Registries - i.e. before a 
package is even downloaded!

To use this extension you will need access to a licensed installation of either:

-   [Sonatype Lifecycle](https://www.sonatype.com/products/open-source-security-dependency-management)
-   [Sonatype Repository Firewall](https://www.sonatype.com/products/sonatype-repository-firewall)

Air-gapped installations will also work.

Whilst this is a [Sonatype Community](https://contribute.sonatype.com) project, this Extension is Supported by Sonatype Inc.
