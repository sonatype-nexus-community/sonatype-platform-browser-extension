The Sonatype Platform Browser Extension allows Developers to get insight from their [Sonatype Platform](https://www.sonatype.com/products/software-supply-chain-management){:target="_blank"} for Open Source packages as you browse Public Open Source Registries - i.e. before a package is even downloaded or used.

To use this extension you will need access to a licensed installation of either:

-   [Sonatype Lifecycle](https://www.sonatype.com/products/open-source-security-dependency-management){:target="_blank"}
-   [Sonatype Repository Firewall](https://www.sonatype.com/products/sonatype-repository-firewall){:target="_blank"}

Sonatype Cloud, on-premise and Air-gapped installations work.

### Officially Supported

Whilst this is a [Sonatype Community](https://contribute.sonatype.com){:target="_blank"} project, this Extension is officially Supported by Sonatype Inc. You can utilise your organizations paid-support options if you encounter issues.
